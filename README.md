# Battleships

Battleships game clone made with HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## Purpose

This project was done as part of the The odin project curriculum. The main purpose was to practice TDD (Test driven development) using Jest. This was the most difficult project till the moment mainly because TDD really makes you think first preventing you from rushing into writing code and it makes you write small units of code (making them testable).
